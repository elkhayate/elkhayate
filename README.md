### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Mohamed Elkhayate

#### Coding Machine

Please note that during my previous roles, I primarily used my employers' GitHub accounts for all work-related contributions, which is why my personal GitHub appears inactive. However, I'm now reactivating my personal account and looking forward to showcasing my work. If given the opportunity to join your team, Iâ€™d be glad to use my own GitHub moving forward.
